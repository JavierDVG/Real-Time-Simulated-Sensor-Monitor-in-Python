# 📊 Real-Time Simulated Sensor Monitor in Python (Colab + Plotly)

This project demonstrates a simple real-time sensor dashboard using simulated data. It was created using **Python**, **Google Colab**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas**, and simulates readings from multiple sensors (temperature, humidity, and pressure) to visualize them dynamically.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates real-time data from:
  - 🌡️ Temperature sensor
  - 💧 Humidity sensor
  - 🌬️ Pressure sensor
- Interactive line charts using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- Real-time updates using `clear_output` and `time.sleep`
- Exports all simulated data to a `.csv` file
- Ready to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
